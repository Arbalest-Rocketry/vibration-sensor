# Vibration Sensor by `David Abeziz`
The objective of this payload is to measure the Vibration frequencies and amplitudes of the flight

To measure vibrations we are using a Piezoelectric material, as these are low cost and used in many application

## Images and Explanations

### Figure 27: Vibration Table Test with multiple frequencies, sampling at 2000Hz
### Figure 28: Single Note Test (330Hz), sampling at 2000Hz

These figures show the results of a vibration table test conducted with multiple frequencies (Figure 27) and a single note test at 330Hz (Figure 28). Both tests were sampled at 2000Hz.

### Figure 29: Short Interval Test, sampling at 4000Hz
### Figure 30: Single Note Test (330Hz), sampling at 4000Hz
